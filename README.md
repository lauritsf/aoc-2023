# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

## Overview
This repository contains my personal solutions for the Advent of Code 2023 challenges. The primary goal is to refine and advance my skills in modern C++. While the main focus is on C++, I might also dabble in Julia for certain challenges to broaden my programming perspectives.

## Language Focus
- **C++**: The primary language used here. I aim to leverage modern C++ features and best practices, focusing on the latest standards (C++17/20/23) to approach the puzzles effectively.
- **Julia**: Secondary and optional. I may experiment with Julia for specific problems where its unique capabilities in numerical computations and performance can be advantageous.

## Structure
Each challenge will have its own directory, such as `day01`, `day02`, etc. Inside each, you'll find:
- A `README.md` detailing the challenge and the approach taken.
- Source code files for the solution(s).

## Goals
- Deepen understanding and proficiency in modern C++.
- Explore and implement advanced C++ features and libraries.
- Experiment with Julia on an exploratory basis for selected problems.
- Enhance problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking.

## Running the Solutions
Instructions for compiling and running the solutions will be provided in the respective directories for each day's challenge.

## Contributing
Feedback and suggestions are always welcome. Feel free to raise issues or contribute through pull requests.
